   The code here Will give you the IP Address;

This will work for a remote client request to SQL 2008 and newer.

If you have Shared Memory connections allowed, then running above on the server itself will give you

"Shared Memory" as the value for 'net_transport', 
and NULL for 'local_net_address',
and '<local machine>' will be shown in 'client_net_address'.'client_net_address' 
it is the address of the computer that the request originated from, 
whereas 'local_net_address' would be the SQL server (thus NULL over Shared Memory connections),
and the address you would give to someone if they can't use the server's NetBios name or FQDN for some reason.
